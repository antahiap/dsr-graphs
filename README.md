## Introduction to graph neural networks for Data Science Retreat
### Useful resources
- [Graph Representation Learing](https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~wlh/grl_book/): A great introductory book on graph neural networks.
- [Network Science (Chapter 2, Graph Theory)](http://networksciencebook.com/chapter/2): A very well written explanation of the basis of the graph theory.
- [Relational inductive biases, deep learning, and graph networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.01261): A DeepMind article that introduces a general approach for learning on graphs.
- [PyTorch Geometric](https://github.com/pyg-team/pytorch_geometric): A great library for deep learning with graphs.
